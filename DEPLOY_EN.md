# 📦 Deployment Guide

This document provides detailed instructions for two recommended deployment methods for PaperPhonePlus, along with client-side server address configuration for all platforms.

> **Key Concept**: The backend (server), database (MySQL), and cache (Redis) are deployed on a server; the frontend (client) can be independently deployed to CDN platforms like Vercel for better global performance. All clients (iOS / Android / Web / Windows / macOS) connect to the backend by entering the **server's address**.

## Method 1: Zeabur Template + Vercel Frontend (Recommended)

This approach deploys server, MySQL, and Redis on the Zeabur cloud platform, while the frontend is deployed to Vercel CDN for globally accelerated access.

### Step 1: Deploy Using the Zeabur Template

1. Click the one-click deploy button:

   [![Deploy on Zeabur](https://zeabur.com/button.svg)](https://zeabur.com/templates/SK6T93?referralCode=619dev)

2. Log in to your Zeabur account (GitHub login supported)
3. Select a deployment region (choose the region closest to your target users)
4. Fill in the environment variables as prompted (`JWT_SECRET`, `R2_*`, etc.) — see the [README](README_EN.md) for environment variable details
5. Wait for all services to finish starting

### Step 2: Delete the client Service on Zeabur

After deployment, Zeabur will automatically create four services: `client` (frontend), `server` (backend), `MySQL`, and `Redis`. Since we want to deploy the frontend separately on Vercel, we need to delete the client service on Zeabur:

1. Go to the [Zeabur Dashboard](https://dash.zeabur.com)
2. Find the project you just deployed
3. Click on the **client** service
4. Go to Service Settings → scroll to the bottom and find **Delete Service**
5. Confirm the deletion

> ⚠️ Only delete the `client` service. **Do NOT** delete the `server`, `MySQL`, or `Redis` services.

### Step 3: Note the server Service Domain

1. In the Zeabur Dashboard, click on the **server** service
2. Go to the **Networking** tab
3. Note the server service's public domain, e.g., `https://your-server-xxx.zeabur.app`
4. You can bind a custom domain here if needed

### Step 4: Deploy the Frontend on Vercel

1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account

2. Log in to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and click **Add New Project**

3. Import your forked repository from GitHub

4. Configure the project settings:

   | Setting | Value |
   |---------|-------|
   | **Root Directory** | `client/` |
   | **Framework Preset** | Vite |
   | **Build Command** | `npm run build` |
   | **Output Directory** | `dist/` |

5. **No environment variables are needed** — users enter the backend server address on the frontend login page

6. Click **Deploy** to start the deployment

7. After deployment, Vercel will assign a domain (e.g., `your-app.vercel.app`). You can also bind a custom domain

### Step 5: Verify the Deployment

1. Open the Vercel-deployed frontend page
2. On the login page, enter the **server** service domain from Zeabur in the server address field (e.g., `https://your-server-xxx.zeabur.app`)
3. Register an account and log in
4. Test messaging, file upload, and other features

---

## Method 2: Docker Compose + Nginx Local Deployment

This approach is suitable for users with their own servers. All services (except the frontend) are deployed via Docker Compose, with Nginx serving as a reverse proxy providing HTTPS access.

### Step 1: Prepare the Server Environment

**System Requirements**:
- Linux server (Ubuntu 22.04+ / Debian 12+ recommended)
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- A domain name (DNS already pointing to your server IP)
- At least 2GB of RAM recommended

**Install Docker** (if not already installed):
```bash
# Install Docker
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh

# Start Docker service
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo systemctl start docker

# Add current user to docker group (no sudo needed)
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
# Log out and back in for the group change to take effect
```

### Step 2: Clone the Project and Configure

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repo-url> && cd paperphone-plus

# Copy and edit environment variables
cp server/.env.example server/.env
```

Edit the `server/.env` file and configure the necessary environment variables:

```bash
# Required configuration — must change
JWT_SECRET=your_random_secret_string          # Must change for production
DB_PASS=your_database_password                # Keep consistent with docker-compose.yml
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_admin_panel_password      # Must change for production

# Optional configuration (fill in as needed)
R2_ACCOUNT_ID=...                             # Cloudflare R2 file storage
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
R2_BUCKET=...
CF_CALLS_APP_ID=...                           # Cloudflare TURN (video calls)
CF_CALLS_APP_SECRET=...
VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=...                          # Web Push notifications
VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=...
```

### Step 3: Modify docker-compose.yml — Remove the client Section

Since the frontend will be served directly through Nginx (or deployed to Vercel), you need to remove the `client` service from `docker-compose.yml`.

Edit `docker-compose.yml` and **delete the following block**:

```yaml
  # ── Frontend (Nginx + React SPA) ────────────────────────────
  client:
    container_name: paperphone-plus-client
    image: facilisvelox/paperphone-plus-client:latest
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    depends_on:
      server:
        condition: service_healthy
    restart: unless-stopped
```

After deletion, `docker-compose.yml` should only contain the `server`, `mysql`, and `redis` services.

### Step 4: Start Docker Services

```bash
# Start all services (backend + MySQL + Redis)
docker compose up -d

# Check service status
docker compose ps

# View logs
docker compose logs -f server
```

Confirm all services show `running` and `healthy` status. The server will automatically create database tables on first startup — no manual SQL import is needed.

### Step 5: Build Frontend Static Files

There are two ways to obtain the frontend static files:

**Option A: Build Locally (Recommended)**

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run build
# Build output will be in client/dist/
```

**Option B: Extract from Docker Image**

```bash
# Create a temporary container and copy files
docker create --name temp-client facilisvelox/paperphone-plus-client:latest
docker cp temp-client:/usr/share/nginx/html ./client/dist
docker rm temp-client
```

### Step 6: Install and Configure Nginx

**Install Nginx**:

```bash
# Ubuntu / Debian
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y nginx

# CentOS / RHEL
sudo yum install -y nginx

# Start Nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx
sudo systemctl start nginx
```

**Install SSL Certificate** (using Let's Encrypt free certificate):

```bash
# Install Certbot
sudo apt install -y certbot python3-certbot-nginx

# Request certificate (replace your.domain.com with your domain)
sudo certbot --nginx -d your.domain.com

# The certificate will be automatically configured in Nginx with auto-renewal
```

**Configure Nginx**:

Create an Nginx site configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/paperphoneplus
```

Enter the following content (replace `your.domain.com` with your domain):

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your.domain.com;
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name your.domain.com;

    ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/your.domain.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/your.domain.com/privkey.pem;

    # SSL security optimizations
    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
    ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:10m;

    # File upload size limit (to support 500MB uploads)
    client_max_body_size 512M;

    # Frontend static files
    location / {
        root /path/to/paperphone-plus/client/dist;
        try_files $uri /index.html;

        # Cache optimization
        location ~* \.(js|css|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|ico|svg|woff|woff2)$ {
            expires 30d;
            add_header Cache-Control "public, immutable";
        }
    }

    # API reverse proxy
    location /api/ {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }

    # WebSocket signaling (real-time communication)
    location /ws {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_read_timeout 3600s;
        proxy_send_timeout 3600s;
    }

    # Admin panel (optional, path should match ADMIN_PATH env var)
    location /admin {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }

    # Health check
    location /health {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
    }
}
```

**Enable the site and restart Nginx**:

```bash
# Create symbolic link to enable the site
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/paperphoneplus /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/

# Remove default site (optional)
sudo rm -f /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default

# Test configuration syntax
sudo nginx -t

# Reload Nginx
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

### Step 7: Verify the Deployment

1. Visit `https://your.domain.com` in a browser — you should see the frontend login page
2. Register an account and test all features
3. Verify that WebSocket connections work correctly (chat messages delivered in real-time)
4. Test file upload functionality

### Troubleshooting

```bash
# Check Docker container status
docker compose ps

# View backend logs
docker compose logs -f server

# View Nginx error logs
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log

# Check port usage
sudo ss -tlnp | grep -E '80|443|3000|3306|6379'

# Restart all services
docker compose restart
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

## Client Server Address Configuration

All clients (iOS, Android, Web, Windows, macOS) should enter the address of the **backend server service**, not the frontend address.

> ⚠️ **Important**: The server address entered in clients is the **backend server's address**, not the frontend web page's address.

### Server Address by Deployment Method

| Deployment Method | Server Address | Example |
|-------------------|---------------|---------|
| **Zeabur** | Domain of the server service on Zeabur | `https://your-server-xxx.zeabur.app` |
| **Docker Compose + Nginx** | Your domain (Nginx proxies to backend) | `https://your.domain.com` |
| **Local Development** | Local backend address | `http://localhost:3000` |

### Configuration for Each Client

#### 📱 iOS App (App Store / PWA)
1. Open the App → go to the login page
2. Enter the server address in the **Server Address** field
3. Example: `https://your-server-xxx.zeabur.app`

#### 🤖 Android App (Google Play)
1. Open the App → go to the login page
2. Enter the server address in the **Server Address** field
3. Example: `https://your-server-xxx.zeabur.app`

#### 🌐 Web (Browser)
1. Open the frontend page deployed on Vercel or Nginx
2. Enter the server address in the **Server Address** field on the login page
3. Example: `https://your-server-xxx.zeabur.app`

#### 🖥️ Windows Client
1. Download and install the [Windows Client](https://github.com/619dev/ppp-win/releases)
2. Open the app → go to the login page
3. Enter the server address in the **Server Address** field
4. Example: `https://your-server-xxx.zeabur.app`

#### 🍎 macOS Client
1. Download and install the [Mac Client](https://github.com/619dev/ppp-mac/releases)
2. Open the app → go to the login page
3. Enter the server address in the **Server Address** field
4. Example: `https://your-server-xxx.zeabur.app`

### Special Note for Docker Compose + Nginx Deployment

When using Docker Compose + Nginx deployment, the frontend and backend share the same domain (via Nginx reverse proxy). In this case, the server address to enter in clients is simply your domain:

```
Server Address: https://your.domain.com
```

Nginx automatically routes API requests (`/api/*`) and WebSocket connections (`/ws`) to the backend server container based on the request path.

## FAQ

### Q: Can the frontend and backend be deployed on different domains?
**A:** Yes. The frontend supports manually entering the backend server address on the login page, so the frontend and backend do not need to share the same domain.

### Q: Does the Vercel-deployed frontend need environment variables?
**A:** No. The server address is entered by users on the login page — no pre-configuration is needed.

### Q: Why is it recommended to remove the client service from Zeabur/Docker?
**A:** Deploying the frontend to Vercel leverages its global CDN for faster user access worldwide. It also reduces server load, allowing the server to focus on backend processing.

### Q: Does iOS PWA require HTTPS?
**A:** Yes. WebRTC and Web Crypto APIs must run in an HTTPS (secure context) environment. The iOS PWA "Add to Home Screen" feature also requires HTTPS.

### Q: How do I update the deployment?
**A:**
- **Zeabur**: Redeploy the server service in the Dashboard
- **Docker Compose**: Run `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`
- **Vercel Frontend**: Push to GitHub and Vercel will automatically trigger redeployment
